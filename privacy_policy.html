    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: January 8, 2026</p>

    <h2>Trail Camera Organizer</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy describes how Trail Camera Organizer ("the App") handles information.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection</h2>
    <p>The App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. The App:</p>

        <li>Does not use analytics or tracking services</li>
        <li>Does not display advertisements</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The App displays trail camera photos stored on external cloud servers. These photos are accessed read-only and are not modified by the App. No data is stored locally on your device except for temporary image caches that can be cleared through your device settings.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.</p>
